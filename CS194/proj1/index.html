    <div style="padding-bottom: 2mm"><span style="font-weight:bold">Objective:</span> Given three black-and-white photographs taken through red, green and blue glass plates, reconstruct the original color photo by aligning the black-and-white images.</div>

    <div><span style="font-weight:bold">Naive method:</span> First, I implemented a naive image alignment method using Normalized Cross Correlation as the distance metric. Distance computation is only performed using the middle 80% of the image to minimize interference from damaged or inconsistent edges. This procedure performs a brute force search within a [-15 15] window of the origin (top left corner of the blue image) and aligns the red and green glass plate images at the point of minimal distance to the blue image. While this was easily accomplished on small jpg images, which tended to be on the order of 400-500 pixels wide, this was entirely unsuitable for the much larger tif images.</div>

    <div><span style="font-weight:bold">Advanced Alignment (Image Pyramid):</span> To align tif images, I had no choice but to use more advanced alignment techniques. To save on computation, I used image pyramids to significantly decrease the search space. The technique works by repeatedly downsampling the target and source images until a pre-defined threshold(my algorithm treated any image with dimensions below 500 pixels as a base case). Image alignment is then performed in a [-15 15] window at the lowest level and within a [-2 2] window at all higher levels. </div>
